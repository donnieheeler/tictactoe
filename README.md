Created this a few weeks ago. It is kinda dumb and written in a bad way but I just wanted to practice some C++ without watching a Youtube tutorial.

Have turned this into a different project all together. Now I am working on having the computer play itself a few times. Then it will create a chart listing the best starting positions. Currently it is unable to have any tactics so the first version will be based off of completely random choices.

Really excited about the last upload. It finally worked. The first game it played that I was able to understand is, 5x5o2o4x8o6x
